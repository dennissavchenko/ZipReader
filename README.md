**Title: Zip File Analysis and Processing Tool**

**Description:**
This Python script provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing and processing ZIP files. Whether your ZIP file is password-protected or not, this tool has you covered. It efficiently handles password detection from a list of commonly used passwords and unpacks the ZIP file to extract its contents. Once extracted, it generates a detailed report containing file names, checksums, and VirusTotal analysis results for each file. Moreover, it intelligently scans text and PDF files for keywords and unique email addresses.

After generating the report, the tool saves its checksum for verification purposes. Additionally, it compresses all extracted files, along with the report and checksum, into a new password-protected ZIP file. To enhance security, a password clue image is created using steganography, concealing the password hint within a random image fetched from the Unsplash API.

For user convenience, a web interface is provided using Streamlit, allowing users to easily upload ZIP files, process them, and view the generated report, log, and checksum files. The new ZIP file, along with the password clue image, can be downloaded directly from the web page.

**Features:**
- Handles both password-protected and unprotected ZIP files.
- Password detection from a list of commonly used passwords.
- Generates a detailed report with file information and VirusTotal analysis.
- Intelligent keyword and email address scanning in text and PDF files.
- Saves checksum of the generated report for verification.
- Compression of extracted files into a new password-protected ZIP file.
- Creation of a password clue image using steganography.
- User-friendly web interface with Streamlit for easy file upload and processing.

**Usage:**
1. Upload your ZIP file using the provided interface.
2. Process the uploaded file to generate a detailed report.
3. View and download the generated report, log, and checksum files.
4. Download the new password-protected ZIP file and the password clue image.

**Note:**
Ensure to review the generated report thoroughly for any security-related findings and recommendations.
