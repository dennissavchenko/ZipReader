Summary:
The code is a Python script designed to analyze and process zip files. It performs the following tasks:

1. Validation: Checks if the provided file path corresponds to a valid zip file.
2. Password Check: Attempts to find the correct password for password-protected zip files using a collection of common passwords.
3. Decryption and File Listing: Decrypts the zip file and lists all files contained within it.
4. Checksum Generation: Generates a SHA-256 checksum for each file within the zip.
5. VirusTotal Query: Queries the VirusTotal service for each file's hash to evaluate if they are flagged as malicious.
6. Keyword Search: Searches text (.txt) and PDF (.pdf) files within the zip for specific keywords like PESEL, password, and email addresses.
7. Report Generation: Generates a report summarizing the results of the analysis, including checksums, VirusTotal evaluations, keyword occurrences, and email addresses.
8. Report Hash Generation: Generates a SHA-256 checksum for the report file and saves it in a separate hash.txt file.
9. Packing into a Password-Protected Zip: Packs all files, including the report and hash.txt, into a new zip file secured with the password "P4$$w0rd!".

The code is well-structured and includes error handling, logging, and modularization for clarity and maintainability.
